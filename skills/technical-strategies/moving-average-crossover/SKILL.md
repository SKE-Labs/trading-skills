# Moving Average Crossover Trading

MA crossovers provide simple, systematic signals for trend identification and entry timing.

## Common MA Combinations

| Fast MA | Slow MA | Use Case         |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 5 EMA   | 13 EMA  | Scalping         |
| 9 EMA   | 21 EMA  | Day trading      |
| 20 SMA  | 50 SMA  | Swing trading    |
| 50 SMA  | 200 SMA | Position trading |

## Classic Signals

### Golden Cross (Bullish)

- Fast MA crosses ABOVE slow MA
- Indicates uptrend beginning
- Best when price is above both MAs

### Death Cross (Bearish)

- Fast MA crosses BELOW slow MA
- Indicates downtrend beginning
- Best when price is below both MAs

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Basic Crossover

- Enter on cross in direction
- Exit on opposite cross
- Simple but can have whipsaws

### 2. Price + MA Confirmation

- Wait for crossover
- THEN wait for price to pullback to fast MA
- Enter on bounce from MA
- Reduces whipsaws

### 3. Triple MA System (5-8-13)

Popular Investopedia strategy:

- All 3 aligned = Strong trend
- Entry: 5 crosses 8, both above 13
- Exit: 5 crosses below 8

### 4. MA as Dynamic S/R

- In uptrend: MA acts as support
- In downtrend: MA acts as resistance
- Trade bounces from MA in trend direction

## Workflow

1. **Get MAs** using `get_indicator(indicator="ema", period=X)`
2. **Identify cross** direction
3. **Confirm with price** position relative to MAs
4. **Enter on pullback** to MA or aggressive on cross
5. **Stop loss** beyond recent swing or far MA
6. **Exit** on opposite cross or target

## EMA vs SMA

| Type | Pros            | Cons           |
| ---- | --------------- | -------------- |
| EMA  | Faster response | More whipsaws  |
| SMA  | Smoother        | Slower signals |

## Best Practices

- Use in trending markets (avoid ranges)
- Combine with other confluence
- Faster MAs = more signals, more false signals
- Slower MAs = fewer signals, more reliable
