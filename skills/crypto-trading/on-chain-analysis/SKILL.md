# On-Chain Analysis

On-chain analysis examines blockchain data to understand market participant behavior.

## Key On-Chain Metrics

### Exchange Flows

| Metric            | Bullish             | Bearish        |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Exchange inflow   | Low                 | High (selling) |
| Exchange outflow  | High (accumulation) | Low            |
| Exchange reserves | Decreasing          | Increasing     |

### Wallet Activity

| Metric                  | Bullish    | Bearish    |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Whale accumulation      | High       | Low        |
| Long-term holder supply | Increasing | Decreasing |
| Active addresses        | Growing    | Declining  |

### Network Health

| Metric             | Bullish    | Bearish    |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Hash rate          | Increasing | Decreasing |
| Transaction volume | Growing    | Stagnant   |
| New addresses      | Growing    | Declining  |

## Trading Signals

### 1. Exchange Outflow Signal

- Large outflows = Accumulation
- Coins moving to cold storage
- Bullish medium-term

### 2. Whale Alert

- Large transactions (>1000 BTC) to exchange = Potential sell
- Large transactions to wallet = Accumulation
- Context matters

### 3. Long-Term Holder Behavior

- LTH supply increasing = Accumulation phase
- LTH selling = Distribution phase
- Often precedes major moves

### 4. Miner Activity

- Miners accumulating = Bullish
- Miners selling heavily = Need to cover costs (bearish)
- Post-halving watch

## Workflow

1. **Check exchange flows** (net inflow/outflow)
2. **Monitor whale wallets** (large transactions)
3. **Assess holder behavior** (LTH vs STH)
4. **Combine with price action**
5. **Form macro thesis**

## Popular Tools

- Glassnode
- CryptoQuant
- IntoTheBlock
- Santiment
- Whale Alert

## Limitations

| Limitation      | Reality                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Lagging         | On-chain data often confirms, not predicts |
| Context needed  | Large transfer could be internal           |
| Not timing tool | Better for macro, not day trading          |

## Best Use

On-chain is best for:

- Macro positioning (accumulation zones)
- Confirming trend changes
- Understanding smart money behavior
- Long-term investment decisions

Less useful for:

- Day trading
- Short-term timing
- Quick trades
