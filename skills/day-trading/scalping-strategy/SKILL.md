- Tight stops required

### 4. Range Scalping

- Repeat until range breaks

## Entry Rules

1. **Confirm direction** on 5m (higher TF)
2. **Enter on 1m** in direction of 5m
3. **Tight stop** (5-10 pips max)
4. **Quick target** (1:1 to 1:1.5 R:R)
5. **Exit immediately** if wrong

## Risk Management

| Rule             | Guideline               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Position size    | Small (0.5-1% risk max) |
| Stop loss        | Tight, non-negotiable   |
| Daily loss limit | 2-3% of capital         |
| Trading hours    | Only during high volume |

## Best Practices

- Take breaks regularly
- Stop after 3 consecutive losses
