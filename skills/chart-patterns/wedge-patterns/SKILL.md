# Wedge Pattern Trading

Wedges are converging trendlines that typically signal reversals (most common) or continuations.

## Wedge Types

### Rising Wedge (Mostly Bearish)

- Both lines slope **upward**
- Higher highs + higher lows (but compressing)
- **In uptrend**: Reversal signal (bearish)
- **In downtrend**: Continuation signal (bearish)

### Falling Wedge (Mostly Bullish)

- Both lines slope **downward**
- Lower highs + lower lows (but compressing)
- **In downtrend**: Reversal signal (bullish)
- **In uptrend**: Continuation signal (bullish)

## Wedge vs Triangle

| Pattern  | Upper Line      | Lower Line               |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Wedge    | Sloping         | Sloping (same direction) |
| Triangle | Flat or sloping | Sloping (converging)     |

## Identification Criteria

1. **Two converging trendlines** sloping in same direction
2. **Minimum 4 touch points** (2 per line)
3. **Decreasing volume** during formation
4. **Clear prior trend** exists

## Entry Strategies

### 1. Breakout Entry

- Enter on break of wedge boundary
- Rising wedge: Enter short on downside break
- Falling wedge: Enter long on upside break
- Volume spike confirms

### 2. Retest Entry (Preferred)

- Wait for breakout
- Wait for retest of broken trendline
- Enter on rejection
- Tighter stop, better R:R

## Target Calculation

**Measured Move**:

- Measure height at widest part of wedge
- Project from breakout point

## Chart Drawing

Use `draw_on_chart` with `trend` type:

- Draw upper trendline
- Draw lower trendline
- Both sloping in same direction

## Key Insights

- Rising wedges break down ~68% of the time
- Falling wedges break up ~68% of the time
- Wedges near end of trend = Higher probability reversal
- Failed wedges lead to strong continuation in original direction
