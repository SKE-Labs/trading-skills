# Flag & Pennant Patterns

Flags and pennants are continuation patterns that form during pauses in strong trends.

## Pattern Components

1. **Flagpole**: The strong impulsive move before the pattern
2. **Flag/Pennant**: The consolidation (the pattern itself)
3. **Breakout**: Continuation in direction of flagpole

## Pattern Types

### Bull Flag

- Strong upward move (pole)
- Downward sloping channel (flag)
- Breaks upward to continue

### Bear Flag

- Strong downward move (pole)
- Upward sloping channel (flag)
- Breaks downward to continue

### Pennant (Bull or Bear)

- Strong move (pole)
- Symmetrical triangle consolidation
- Breaks in direction of pole

## Identification Criteria

| Criteria | Flag                | Pennant           |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Shape    | Rectangular channel | Triangle          |
| Duration | Short (1-3 weeks)   | Short (1-3 weeks) |
| Volume   | Decreasing          | Decreasing        |
| Slope    | Against trend       | Neutral           |

## Entry Strategies

### 1. Breakout Entry

- Enter on break of flag/pennant boundary
- Confirm with volume increase
- Stop: Below/above flag structure

### 2. Conservative Entry

- Wait for breakout
- Wait for brief retest
- Enter on bounce from pattern boundary

## Target Calculation

**Flagpole Projection**:

```
Target = Breakout point + Flagpole length
```

Measure the pole, add to breakout level.

## Chart Drawing

Use `draw_on_chart`:

- For flags: Draw 2 parallel `trend` lines (channel)
- For pennants: Draw 2 converging `trend` lines

## Best Practices

- Pole should be strong and impulsive (3+ candles)
- Flag should retrace 38-50% of pole max
- Volume should decline during flag formation
- Breakout should have increased volume
- Quick formations are more reliable
