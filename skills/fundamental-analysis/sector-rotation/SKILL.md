# Sector Rotation Strategy

Rotate investments between sectors based on economic cycle and market conditions.

## Economic Cycle Phases

| Phase               | Economy            | Best Sectors                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Early Expansion** | Recovery begins    | Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Tech |
| **Mid Expansion**   | Growth accelerates | Industrials, Materials, Tech             |
| **Late Expansion**  | Growth peaks       | Energy, Materials, Financials            |
| **Contraction**     | Slowdown/recession | Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples  |

## Sector Classification

### Cyclical (Economy-Sensitive)

- Consumer Discretionary
- Financials
- Industrials
- Materials
- Energy
- Technology

### Defensive (Recession-Resistant)

- Utilities
- Healthcare
- Consumer Staples
- Real Estate (partial)

## Rotation Signals

| Signal                 | Indicates                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Yield curve steepening | Early cycle (cyclicals)       |
| Yield curve flattening | Late cycle (rotate defensive) |
| Fed cutting rates      | Early cycle starting          |
| Fed raising rates      | Late cycle                    |
| Commodities rallying   | Late cycle inflation          |

## Rotation Workflow

1. **Identify economic phase** (leading indicators)
2. **Assess current allocation** (over/underweight)
3. **Identify rotating-in sectors** (early phase sectors)
4. **Identify rotating-out sectors** (late phase sectors)
5. **Execute gradual shift** (not all at once)

| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Diversification  | Never 100% one sector |
| Max allocation   | 30% in any sector     |
| Rotation speed   | Gradual, not sudden   |
| Review frequency | Monthly/quarterly     |

## Current Cycle Assessment

Questions to answer:

- Where are we in the economic cycle?
- What is Fed policy direction?
- Which sectors are leading/lagging?
- What does relative strength show?
