Trade around scheduled economic releases that move markets.

## High-Impact Events

| --------------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| FOMC Rate Decision    | 8x/year   | Very High   | All markets           |
| CPI (Inflation)       | Monthly   | High        | Stocks, Bonds, Crypto |
| NFP (Jobs)            | Monthly   | High        | USD, Stocks           |
| GDP                   | Quarterly | High        | Broad market          |
| PCE (Fed's inflation) | Monthly   | Medium-High | Fed-sensitive         |

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Pre-Event Positioning

- Analyze expectations vs likely outcome
- Position 1-2 days before
- Reduce size for uncertainty

### 2. Straddle Volatility

- Trade the volatility expansion
- Options strategies

### 3. Post-Event Continuation

- Wait for initial reaction (30-60 min)
- Enter continuation of move
- Safest approach

### 4. Fade Overreaction

- Wait for extreme move
- Fade back toward VWAP/mean
- Experienced traders only

## Event Analysis Framework

| Question             | What to Look For          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| What's expected?     | Consensus estimate        |
| What would surprise? | Significantly above/below |
| What's priced in?    | Current price trend       |
| Reaction function    | How market responds       |

## Pre-Event Workflow

1. **Check calendar** for upcoming events
2. **Note consensus** expectations
3. **Assess positioning** (COT, sentiment)
4. **Plan scenarios** (beat, miss, meet)
5. **Size appropriately** (smaller)

## FOMC Special Considerations

| Outcome          | Market Reaction                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Dovish surprise  | Risk-on (stocks up, USD down)  |
| Hawkish surprise | Risk-off (stocks down, USD up) |
| As expected      | Muted, may reverse             |

## Risk Management

| Rule            | Guideline                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Position size   | Reduce 50-75%              |
| No holding into | Reduce before major events |
| Stop loss       | Wider (volatility)         |
| Spreads         | Widen significantly        |

## Best Practices

- Know the calendar (never be surprised)
- Reduce exposure before major events
- Trade reaction, not prediction
- Wait 15-30 min for dust to settle
