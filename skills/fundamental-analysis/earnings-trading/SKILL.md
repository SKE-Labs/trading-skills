# Earnings Trading

Trade volatility and price moves around quarterly earnings announcements.

## Earnings Impact

| Scenario              | Typical Reaction |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Beat + Raise guidance | Strong rally     |
| Beat expectations     | Moderate pop     |
| Meet expectations     | Muted/slight dip |
| Miss expectations     | Drop             |
| Miss + Lower guidance | Strong sell-off  |

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Pre-Earnings Positioning

- Analyze expectations vs reality
- Position 1-5 days before
- Risk: Binary outcome

### 2. Earnings Run-Up

- Buy small caps 2-4 weeks before
- Sell before announcement
- Capture anticipation, avoid event

### 3. Post-Earnings Drift

- Strong beats continue trending up
- Enter after initial reaction settles
- Ride continuation for days/weeks

### 4. Fade Overreaction

- Gap down on decent earnings = Buy
- Gap up on mediocre = Sell
- Requires experience

## Analysis Workflow

Use `get_financial_news` and `get_fundamentals` to:

1. **Research expectations**

   - EPS estimate
   - Revenue estimate
   - Key metrics (users, margins, guidance)

2. **Assess sentiment**

   - Analyst upgrades/downgrades
   - Recent news impact
   - Sector performance

3. **Plan trade**
   - Entry point
   - Position size (reduce for earnings)
   - Exit scenarios

## Risk Management

| Rule            | Guideline            |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Position size   | 50% of normal max    |
| Stop loss       | Wider than normal    |
| Hedging         | Consider options     |
| Holding through | Only with conviction |

## Post-Earnings Analysis

After release, analyze:

- Beat/miss on EPS
- Beat/miss on revenue
- Guidance changes
- Management commentary
- Price reaction vs expectations

## Key Insight

"Buy the rumor, sell the news" often applies. Stocks run up into good expected earnings, then sell on the news even if they beat. Surprise matters more than absolute numbers.
